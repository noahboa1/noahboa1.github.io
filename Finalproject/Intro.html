    <p>Hello! We are SMASH Scholars at UC Berkeley. SMASH Berkeley is a summer program where we take classes in the UC Berkeley campus. The classes consist of Science, Math and Science honors. For our first year, our final project was to create and design a website where it talks about a certain disease. For our project, we decided to make it on chicken pox, and how to bring awareness to it. In order to bring awareness, we wanted to make a school fair where we teach kids and parents the importance of vaccinations against Chickenpox.
