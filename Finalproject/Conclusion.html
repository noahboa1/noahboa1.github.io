  <p>Our group wants to have a school fair for awarness of chicken pox a very dangrous/contagous disease. We could have doctors go to the school fair to give vaccines to the children who have not yet recieved the vaccine of course with the parents consent. This would be important because people would be more likely to get a vaccine in a more freindly enviroment.</p>
  <p>We are plannning on making the fair at the school because when we interviewed 4 people and 3/4 stated that they recieved the chicken pox virus at a very young age due to not having the vaccine and recieving it from classmates in school who were also not vaccinated. </p>
  <p>For our prototype we also found that a good way of promoting the Chicken pox vaccine is making advertisements such as billboards, youtube ads, and tv commercials etc. We this found that promoting from advertisements is a good idea because the ads will eventually reach everyone and then people shall be well informed. </p>
