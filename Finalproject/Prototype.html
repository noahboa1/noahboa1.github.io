  <p>Our group wants to have a school fair for awareness of chicken pox a very dangerous/contagious disease. We could have doctors go to the school fair to give vaccines to the children who have not yet received the vaccine of course with the parent's consent. This would be important because people would be more likely to get a vaccine in a more friendly environment.</p>
  <p>We are planning on making the fair at the school because when we interviewed 4 people and 3/4 stated that they received the chicken pox virus at a very young age due to not having the vaccine and receiving it from classmates in school who were also not vaccinated.</p>
  <p>For our prototype, we also found that a good way of promoting the Chickenpox vaccine is making advertisements such as billboards, youtube ads, and tv commercials etc. We thus found that promoting advertisements is a good idea because the ads will eventually reach everyone and then people shall be well informed.</p>
